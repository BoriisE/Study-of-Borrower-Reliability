# Study-of-Borrower-Reliability
Project Description
The client is the bank’s credit department. The goal is to investigate whether a client’s marital status and number of children affect the likelihood of repaying a loan on time. The input data from the bank consists of statistics on clients’ creditworthiness.
The research results will be used to build a credit scoring model — a special system that assesses a potential borrower’s ability to repay a loan to the bank.
